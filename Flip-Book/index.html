            <p>Even more, the book height is dicated by the amount of content in the tallest page.

            <h2>JS at its minimum</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is at its minimum. Basically it's only used to set the initial
              page index and assign click listeners to the pages. Modifies the CSS <b>Var</b>
              for the <i>current</i> page, and the rest is handled entirely by CSS.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="back">
            <p>Additionally JavaScript allows you to click on an anchor link in your
              text — without turning the page. You can also have multiple independent
              flip books in a single document. You're all covered.</p>

            <h2>Crafting CSS magic</h2>
            <p>The opened (<i>viewing</i>) pages of the flip book are always kept at the same elevation.
            This is necessary if your book has no inclination (is top-down-view).
            Have you noticed that you can also click on the pages edge? CSS will nicely animate the group
              of pages to skip with a staggered animation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="back">
            <p>Like in this demo, you can change the perspective of the parent container and change the
              X axis rotation of the book for extra effect.</p>

        <div class="page">
          <div class="front">
            <p>The necessary FlipBook's CSS is barely 30 lines, there is no swipe, natural page flip angling,
              complex shadows, etc. in order to keep it as simple as possible.</p>

              want to say <i>hi</i>.</p>
